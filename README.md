# Python Coding Automated Parking Slot
The objective of this project is to develop an automated system for analyzing customer parking slot utilization in a parking facility. The system will utilize various sensors and data processing techniques to monitor parking slots in real-time, collect relevant data, and provide actionable insights to optimize parking space usage, improve customer experience, and enhance operational efficiency.
Real-time Monitoring: Deploy sensors to detect the occupancy status of individual parking slots in real-time.
Data Collection: Collect and store data on parking slot occupancy, duration of stay, and frequency of usage.
Analytics: Analyze collected data to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in parking slot utilization.
Visualization: Present analysis results through intuitive visualizations such as graphs, heatmaps, and dashboards for easy interpretation.
Alerts and Notifications: Set up alerts and notifications for parking attendants or management for issues such as overcrowding, vacant slots, or potential violations.
Historical Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports on historical parking utilization trends and performance metrics.
Integration: Ensure compatibility and integration with existing parking management systems or databases.
Scalability: Design the system to be scalable, capable of handling large parking facilities with hundreds or thousands of parking slots.
